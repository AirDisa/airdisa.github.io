Somewhere in there I better add CSS and if feeling ambitious, Sassy Foundation 5.

[Tags][tags] are also supported as variables in Jekyll. This fun is getting totally out of hand! I went in knowing tags were supported but wanted to reserve my use of them for a special purpose. I am kind of a big deal in SEO. I do not concern myself much with it here, except for developing and experimenting with it, like how Jekyll implements tags for posts. I am pretty sure the notion of tags in Jekyll is based on tradition, with flexibility for developers like me to take further. You will find I dutifully populate my post tags.

My initial thought is that I can easily write tags in to the application using them largely on purpose for what is intended. Quickly, I saw a way to take them and simply insert them into meta keywords tags. Along with the excerpt feature that comes complimentary with Jekyll, I have all the essential meta data from simple YAML Front Matter on the raw post files. Nother more needs to be done, and I can save the notion of tags for something in support of this fundamental SEO thing to demonstrate an important point.

Everybody in SEO knows that meta keywords do not result in better rankings, although they used to work fifteen years ago. Over the last decade, people slwoly stopped writing them altogether. I saw this as a sad fact, blaming the commercial Web search engine business (Google!) for ruining a perfectly suitable meta data container. I have long advised people to continue writing them for the successor who might use them, and that successor could be you. If you write good keywords, meant for your users, your own search engine can be built to use them.
