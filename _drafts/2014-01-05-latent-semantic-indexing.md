Yet another featuer I found with Jekyll is related_posts with Latent Semantic Indexing. This is not necessarily super indexing compared with something crafted with keywords, but it comes free and requires no roll-your-own solution. I readily admit to implementing this feature for reasons of pure curiosity, and laziness. These are supposed to be great attributes for a developer.

The thing I know about Latent Semantic Indexing is its magic cannot begin to reveal itself without enough content. Part of the curisoty I have with impoementing this thing is to see if I can adhere to a content creation routine that actually establishes decent indexing with the related_posts feature. The biggest curiosity is obviously in seeing it work being familiar with the content.

Others have written extensions of the feature which is something I will look into doing if needed. There is plenty of features to experiment with. It should not be too difficult to think of something useful that replaces built-in features. I am saddened by only one thing so far, and also without enough content, I see no rationale behind the list of related_posts as others have also noted.
