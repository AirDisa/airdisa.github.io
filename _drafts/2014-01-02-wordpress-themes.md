Somewhere in there I better add CSS and if feeling ambitious, Sassy Foundation 5.

I have written before about Wordpress. It can seem as though dealing in the intricacies, unless you are solely a writer, can be en exercise in sheer madness. The loops, the includes the permissions hierarchy and all the little nits can take the life-force right out of you with each ticking second of the time clock. As a developer, blogging is not very useful except by way of being useful in other online work areas. Blogging can serve to get you noticed with the possibility of paying code work. This is why a task starting Devbootcamp is start a Tumblr.

With so many platforms out there, it can be dizzying to choose from among them or to choose them all to dabble and learn (as I did). I have written in MoveableType and all the rest. MoveableType is like Marlon Brando regretting he could have been a contender, Blogger is like a Yugo and Wordpress is the circus. To me, given these analogies I just made, Tumblr is probably like a Shakespeare play company. Perhaps I think of that way because it funnels user intent better and still provides developers enough flexibility to satisfy the creative itch for code.

Professionally speaking, I think the thing to do is hack on them all in support of your own flexibility to serve the needs of paying clients. To that end, I write Wordpress themes and plugins, configure Tumblr together for projects and especially dabble in blog writing from Rails, Jekyll, and Perl. I anticipate doing so on a Node project for the learning. It is Wordpress that will drive the most work. Writing a theme requires only a few things, initially only an installation. Wordpress can play host though this is not recommended.

I am not a fan of instructing people to install stuff but you might find it easiest to work on local files if you can preview them immediately, and for that you will want Wordpress installed on your machine with PHP. The goal is to deliver a file archived with zip that will decompress into the themes folder in Wordpress. The files are hacked enough you can find starting packages from developers all over the place. At the time of this writing, I tended to favor JountsWP that is blank except integrated with Foundation 5.

The only thing barely ever described well is how it all works. Everyone wants to write about the code and leaves out basic details, or hurriedly describes them using fast language that can be hard to decipher precisely what is meant. Wordpress will search the themes directory for valid theme files written using PHP and HTML. You have to write by convention so that Wordpress will recognize your code as a theme. Assuming you start from scratch, you can simply copy themes provided by the Wordpress installation to hack those files and switch images.

The dangerous part for users is that using the theme dialog, they can upload anything zipped that they think is a theme. That is why I describe Wordpress as a circus carnival. All manner of free themes and plugins are out there written by every hacker Jack out for a thrill. Some of these themes are popular because they can seem alright, yet they come with a payload of links, or worse. Wordpress madness is when innocent bloggers get excited about all the free stuff then hire you to fix it. They want the features and they do not know about the malware.

So the best answer is to have your own theme yard of clean code ready to handle whatever may get thrown your way. That way you can most sanely handle Wordpress madness by adapting desired features, keeping what is good and knowing your code is not going to inherit something awful. It has never been easier to start your own with a leg up on responsive design, given [JointsWP][jointswp] you have a blank sheet that as far as I can tell having worked with it, is fully free of malware, free to use and do with what you want without worrying about copyrights. It works!
