<p>The best time to establish version control is beginning before the first version. Register with GitHub or refresh you familiarity with GitHub if you are already registered. GitHub is more than version control and it&#39;s where the developer community hangs out. GitHub is like the skateboard park for developers with company scouts looking for talent. No time like the present. Now&#39;s the time. Go get GitHub going.</p>

<ul>
  <li>GitHub: A version tracking system with collaboration features.</li>
  <li>Gist: A file, or group of files at GitHub to share or demonstrate code.</li>
  <li>Repo: A central code repository that can be branched for larger collaboration.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what can you expect from GitHub? There are several parts to GitHub including implementations. The first thing you&#39;ll notice is an activity wall. Try to focus first on learning about gists and repos. A gist is a file or group of related files which can be comprised of virtually anything. There is a huge benefit to learning how to use gists in that you can include them like you would a Twitter plugin anywhere you can paste code on the Web.</p>

<p>All you need is to know how to edit the following src attribute for the specific gist you want:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AirDisa/8124295.js"></script>

<p>Repos are where the version control system really kicks into high gear in that a repo has the capability to branch, like a tree. This allows not only version control of your software, but collaboration and feature contributions from other developers. The idea is to write code, contribute to code repositories and documentation in order to populate your GitHub activity for personal growth. It&#39;s never too late to start and always a good idea to get going. Browse the <a href="https://github.com/AirDisa?tab=repositories">AirDisa repos &amp; source code</a>.</p>
