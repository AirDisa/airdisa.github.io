            <h2>TransH4ck Chicago</h2>
<p class="meta">28 Mar 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Starting the night with Trans4Hack @Devbootcamp #Chicago, we are just now gathering for the evening. Although I imagine there will be some talk, there is a TransGeek film in progress. I went ahead and signed a release even while people are allowed to opt for a variety of safety reasons IRL. I met the founder and Aaron is here. I found out that Coraline was meant to be here as well but she is in Salt Lake city presumably there to be hired. Instructure? (Turns out this was true).</p>

<p>The founder is talking about this being the third TransH4ck. GitHub is one of the sponsors, and all our hacking is going to be open source. We will start with a GitHub tutorial. We have GitHub presence here (Scottish man name Mike) to walk us through the service. It is very neat that a film is being made, let alone one called TransGeek. Nice! Aw what the hell, I might as well show up in it for Chicago and for to have a chance to run a screed, although I have not intense reason to.</p>

<p>I start a major project on Monday and I have weekend projects that I have to do as well, so this is going to be tough. All that means is a busy weekend. If I can be of use here at TransH4ck, then I should definitely add to the effort what I can. With Aaron hanging around but only a bit before he flies off to Paris, then it is the least I can do to lend a hand. We are starting to go around the room introducing ourselves. The group is big enough this will take some measure of time.</p>

<p>People are pitching app ideas. We are announcing our preferred pronouns because we are sometime a bit dis-ambiguous in appearance. I know I already messed up once with a woman named Joe. It is also Fox graduation day, so there is at least one Fox here to mentor a bit too, a friend I recognize from last year. I tried to install the R programming language because Joe is a data scientist and does all his hacking with R. I had first come across it a bit when I read about unix.</p>

<p>I guess one big thing here now is a talk that was held at Ted just prior to this event, the speaker from that appearance is here, which I think is totally cool. She made a point to tell us hers was the first Ted talk by trans which was allowed. I will definitely need to go and check out that video with a launch on Monday at 11am. Of course, I will be meeting just 30 minutes later as a kick off for my new project and that interferes.</p>
