<p class="meta">01 Jan 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/">Tags</a> are also supported in Jekyll. The fun I am having is getting totally out of hand! I went in knowing tags were supported but wanted to reserve my use of them for some special purpose. But what? I am supposed to be kind of a big deal in SEO and it is because I can think of nifty things that influence people. Admittedly, not many SEOs are going to learn Jekyll and that is part of why I love it so. No one follows though they should. Tag 2014 as it for developer SEO.</p>

<p>I do not concern myself much with SEO here, except for developing and experimenting with my own esoteric thinking, like how to manipulate how Jekyll implements tags for posts to stretch their meaning for search engines. I am pretty sure the notion of tags in Jekyll is based on tradition and with flexibility for developers like me who want to take it further. You will find I dutifully populate post tags accordingly.</p>

<p>So what to do? My initial thought was that I can easily write tags in the application using them in the standard way, tag cloud navigation. That then becomes obvious for populating meta keywords. Along with the excerpt feature that comes complimentary with Jekyll, I now have all the essential meta data from simple YAML Front Matter. I can save the notion of tags for something in support of something more fundamentally rad for a futuristic SEO thing and demonstrate an important point.</p>

<p>Everybody in SEO knows that meta keywords do not result in better rankings, although they used to work fifteen years ago. Over the last decade, people slowly stopped writing them altogether. I saw this as a sad fact, blaming the commercial Web search engine business (Google!) for ruining a perfectly suitable meta data container. I have long advised people to continue writing them for the successor search engine who might use them, and that successor could be you. If you write good keywords you can build a better search engine built to use them.</p>
