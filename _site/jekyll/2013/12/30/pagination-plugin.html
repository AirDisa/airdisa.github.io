          <h2>Jekyll Pagination Plugin</h2>
<p class="meta">30 Dec 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Determined to add content here, I took note of the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/">pagination</a> feature built right in to Jekyll. I had put this aside until now, for reasons of busyness, but now I have taken it upon myself to actually implement the pagination scheme. This helps me get the feel for Jekyll better before I get to doing something more complicated. I know it takes a great effort to contribute on a daily basis and failure is not unknown to me or those with dead blogs laying around.</p>

<p>While looking at plugins I might like to install, or roll my own by writing one from scratch, one of the things I stumbled upon reading in the documentation is a flat file data store. How cool is that? While seeing lots of reference to YAML, I had not really delved too deeply in it for the simple matter of time. I know learning it is brainlessly fast, and I therefore will put something like that off until implementation time, just like Jekyll itself.</p>

<p>So all this is enough to keep me busy learning fun stuff while trying to not fall behind on commercial coding work. I have become caught up enough in it that I could only add pagination in the short time I took for a break before getting back to working on paying code. So the plan is to dabble with writing a plugin, potentially using YAML data constructs and enjoy watching the pagination at work the more I write. Somewhere in there I better add CSS, maybe Foundation 5 on SASS.</p>
