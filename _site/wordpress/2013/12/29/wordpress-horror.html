          <h2>Wordpress Horrors</h2>
<p class="meta">29 Dec 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>As mentioned before, you are bound to run into Wordpress during your life as a developer. If you are lucky, you get to avoid Wordpress horror, or you become so familiar with it that it no longer haunts you. I find little room for life in between, myself. I think I was comfortable knowing nothing about Wordpress. Those days were numbered. I have had to begin thinking on the opposite side of the spectrum.</p>

<p>Here are some nits that I will complain about. Finding a good work flow can be extremely time-consuming if you are doing anything more complicated than what an be done with the built-in code editor. Even so, the editor only offers clumsy going. When I code a new theme or plugin and Wordpress is not installed locally, I quickly pay a time toll tax.</p>

<p>I try to reserve my machine for running my business. It makes me irritable to run anything that is not related to that essential set of tasks. A development machine can live too close to the edge, where project problems might interfere with day-to-day operations. When work warrants it, then I need to install something. The point is I do not <em>want</em> to install anything.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> <span class="nx">the_content</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nv">$more_link_text</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$stripteaser</span> <span class="p">);</span> <span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/the_content">Wordpress documentation</a> says the method the<em>content has to run in <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop">the_loop</a>. This is where Wordpress mazes and loops materialize. Madness ensues. PHP methods named the</em>content, params named stripteaser running in the<em>loop, you can only use this stuff where you expect post excerpts because as global sounding as the</em>content is, it is confined in scope.</p>

<p>Memorize this if you must but it sure is nice to be blissfully unaware. My sense of order became overwhelmed by the madness of it, I have resigned to detailed memorization. Let us not forget the gallery of criminally-coded themes and plugins. Instant base64 encoded links to casinos! There is rationale (excuses) behind everything but Jekyll is a such a thing of beauty compared.</p>
