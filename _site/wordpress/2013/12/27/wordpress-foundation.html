          <h2>Wordpress Foundation 5</h2>
<p class="meta">27 Dec 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Wordpress is popular. It powers roughly 20% of the Web, which is a 5% increase over the last such milestone figure I remember. If you are going to get into development, you are bound to run into Wordpress. For many, Wordpress is all the do, perhaps all they know. As much as I might prefer other pub.ishing methods, we all need to hack on Wordpress.</p>

<p>Wordpress means mazes of PHP includes and loops. As of the time of this writing, there is a new version, and it is less horror than previous version but plenty of horror to be sure. for one thing, the workflow can be pretty messed up, unless you want to mess with Wordpress on your own machine. I am not a big fan of the idea but understand why those who do, do.</p>

<p>Foundation, the responsive framework which beats Twitter Bootstrap, can shoe horn into Wordpress. There is a relatively empty ready-made install of this called <a href="http://jointswp.com">JointsWP</a> that can take some of the pain away. Anything like that is going to add more includes and loops for more maze but it is well worth the concentration cost to learn the ropes.</p>
