          <h2>Wordpress Foundation 5</h2>
<p class="meta">27 Dec 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>If you are going to get into development, you are bound to run into Wordpress. Wordpress is popular. It powers roughly 20% of the Web, a 5% increase over the last such milestone I remember hearing about the Wordpress Web. For many, Wordpress is all they care to do, perhaps all they know how to do - and that is okay. As much as I might prefer learning other things, I get stuck hacking Wordpress lots at some point.</p>

<p>Wordpress means mazes of PHP includes and loops. At the time of this writing, the newest version contains fewer horrors than previous versions but plenty of horror nonetheless. For one thing the work flow can be pretty messed up, unless you want to deal with installing Wordpress on your own machine. I am not a big fan of the idea, but understand why those who do that, do that. I admit to have resorting to it though I totally prefer to hot fix.</p>

<p>Foundation 5, a top responsive framework, can shoehorn into Wordpress and give it some great possible outcomes. Don&#39;t worry, be happy. There is a superb ready-made implementation of Foundation 5 and Wordpress in both CSS and SASS distributions called <a href="http://jointswp.com">JointsWP</a>, which gives us a terrific head start. Anything like that is going to add some more includes and loops for more maze to amazing but it is well worth the effort to learn the ropes.</p>
