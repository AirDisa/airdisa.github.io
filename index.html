    <p>Projects I'd be glad to have contributors and collaborators for include RailsSEO. I have some upcoming talks about SEO to developers and will pitch speaking on it at RailsConf in Chicago. Your work can get credited if it goes in. I'm fishing for FOSS ideas that can make SEO a snap afterthought.</a></p>
