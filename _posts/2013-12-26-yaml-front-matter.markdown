The Jekyll templates use a plain text file interface for populating website pages dynamically, and it's got blog aware features for coders to take advantage of. The idea is simple, pretty powerful, and can leverage your programming skills fast. It dynamically translates blocks of '[Front Matter][front-matter]' code in plain text files to static code for the Web.

People who don't code might ask why. Why code something from scratch when instead you can go with ready-made Wordpress? The answer can only lie in your love for learning code. You either have it, or you don't. There is no rational reason to take the time to learn this stuff when you can literally fire up Wordpress and write, like what writers do.

Learning to code takes perseverance, and concentration. Front matter is simple enough that it doesn't require much coding skill. It can be learned quickly, the perfect platform to get into coding without diving headfirst into something like Java. Java is an awesome language. Jekyll doesn't compare. Jekyll can get you started more easily.
