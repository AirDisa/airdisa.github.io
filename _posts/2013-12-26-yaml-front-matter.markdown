The Jekyll templating system uses a plain text file interface for users to populate their website or power their blog with. It's very similar to something I built in Perl to do a little blogging at one of my domains. Since this is the one utilized for GitHub pages, it makes sense for me to spend my time learning the innards of this before continuing or scrapping altogether my own Perl templating system.

The idea is pretty simple, and powerful leveraging programming language know-how. Perl is excellent at text file manipulation and is ideal for translating blocks dynamically into something utilized in HTML for the Web. In Jekyll, this is accomplished with what they call '[Front Matter][front-matter]' and is largely the same as what I've done with Perl elsewhere.

All you need is to know how to edit the following src attribute for the specific gist you want:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AirDisa/8124295.js"></script>

Repos are where the version control system really kicks into high gear in that a repo has the capability to branch, like a tree. This allows not only version control of your software, but collaboration and feature contributions from other developers. The idea is to write code, contribute to code repositories and documentation in order to populate your GitHub activity for personal growth. It's never too late to start and always a good idea to get going. Browse the [AirDisa repos &amp; source code][airdisa-github].
