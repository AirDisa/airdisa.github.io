I first came across Sencha a few years ago, before I dug in and learned more about it last weekend. I started to fall in love with the framework, which is fitting being that it was Valentine&quot;s Day when I started in. Love at first sight for the blindness of it all until things become clear. While Sencha is fully featured with robust documentation (venture capital backed), it is not SEO friendly. Be that as it may, I have the pang of nostalgia for the memory of that moment in discovery.

It was dabbling with Mojito that I came across Sencha. While Mojito is a Yahoo! YUI project, and pretty awesome, Sencha means business. I have to pay attention to that. There are some similarities between the frameworks even while they are powered very differently. Sencha has Java in its midst, with some Ruby and a JSON developer interface. Mojito has Node.js for its primary platform but also with a JSON developer interface. The drawback to these approaches is neither can boast search engine friendliness.

Aw well.
