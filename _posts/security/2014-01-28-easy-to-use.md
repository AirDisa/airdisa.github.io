About 45 minutes in, the following video demonstration of the environment in which the Mac was originally released, which really illustrates what made it revolutionary through the lens of today. It is important to remember this as the very beginning of something which became huge and a truly important historical frame for it. It is a long video that starts with plenty of hype from Steve Jobs and ends with remarks by Steve Wozniak heard in conversation. The revolution the Mac brought led to our security and privacy concerns which we have today.

This has to do with security by virtue of the recent NSA revelations and the provocative Orwellian commercial for the Mac. There is one other important frame at work in this video, where Woz speaks of computer user groups the Apple computer grew out of. The timing and area of interest shared by these original hackers, Captain Crunch, Kevin Mitnick and Steve Wozniak let to vastly different outcomes. When I spoke with Kevin about ciphers for his book, he needed to call Woz when we learned of the death of Steve Jobs in that moment.
