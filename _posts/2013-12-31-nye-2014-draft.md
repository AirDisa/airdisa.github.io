Happy New Year in advance!

[Drafts][drafts] are another thing that is supported by Jekyll. I am writing a draft now in such a way as to take advantage of a Front Matter feature {% highlight YAML %}published: false{% endhighlight %}. I had originally hoped the _drafts folder feature provided by Jekyll might be more useful on GitHub and was disappointed at first. When I originally drafted this piece, I had not yet implemented it. As explained, this post is being written as a draft using using the original Front Matter method. It struck me as fitting to write about drafts for a post destined to go out on New Year&#39;s Eve.

I wanted to learn the folder method and preview before the year is out, and so I ultimately did. The result is that this page was further drafted and previewed, completed after a build process with its appearance in _drafts. I will say that it is probably a little less convenient than simply flipping a {% highlight YAML %}published: false{% endhighlight %} switch in Front Matter. You have to move files between folders, which can mistakenly overwrite them, or other gotcha side effects can interfere with versioning, maybe something worse unforeseen. Regularly using Jekyll server in exchange for all that fretting is a treat though.
