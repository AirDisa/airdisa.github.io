[Drafts][drafts] are also supported by Jekyll. While I am writing drafts in such a way as to take advantage of a Front Matter feature (published: true | false), I can hopefully learn to find a better method in the draft feature itself. This is not something I have looked into yet. This post is being written as a draft using the original method and I will link to the documentation on drafts to read up later. How fitting it is that I am writing a draft on drafts for a New Year&#39;s Eve post.

Update: I went and looked at the drafts documentation and the feature does not actually make sense for me. The reason is that I might use them if I used Jekyll serve for viewing the site in a preview mode and I am more prone to hotfix and I like to live dangerously. I am never more the hotfix girl than when the stakes are not so high. What is the worst that can happen to a Jekyll site? That it does not render on build? Maybe I publish files that are screwed up. It is not going to be so screwed up as to ruin me.

So in summary, I wrote this long before I published it. All I need to do is flip the switch the day of New Year&#39;s Eve and go have my fun. Potentially there will be something I can write, like a generator, that will stage some content somewhere without plugging it entirely into the structure of my Jekyll site on GitHub. Until then, I will continue to use the plain old simply old-school draft feature using the Front Matter published statement. The only downside is preview. I do not really need to preview basic markdown.
