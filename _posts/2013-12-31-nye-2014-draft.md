[Drafts][drafts] are another thing that is supported by Jekyll. I am writing a draft now in such a way as to take advantage of a Front Matter feature (published: true | false). I had hoped the actual drafts feature provided by Jekyll might be more useful and when I originally drafted this piece, I had not yet looked into it.

As explained, this post is being written as a draft using using the original Front Matter method. It struck me as fitting to write about drafts for a post destined to go out on New Year&#39;s Eve. I wanted to learn the new directory and preview method by then, and so I did. This resulting page was previewed and completed after a build process with its appearance in _drafts.

I will say that it is probably a little more inconvenient than simply flipping a published: ( true or false ) switch in Front Matter. You have to move files between folders, which can have overwrite side effects that may interfere with versioning, or worse. Regularly using the simple Jekyll server in exchange for that is obviously a great benefit in my view. Happy New Year in advance!
