If you are going to get into development, you are bound to run into Wordpress. Wordpress is popular. It powers roughly 20% of the Web, a 5% increase over the last such milestone I remember hearing. For many, Wordpress is all they care to do, perhaps all they know how to do - and that is okay. As much as I might prefer learning other things, I get stuck hacking Wordpress lots at some point. Wordpress means mazes of PHP includes and loops. The version I work now contains fewer horrors than previous versions but plenty of horror nonetheless.

For one thing, my work flow gets messed up, unless I deal with installing Wordpress on your my machine. I am not a big fan of the idea, but understand why those who do that, do that. I prefer to hot fix. Foundation 5, a nice responsive framework, can shoehorn into Wordpress and give it some greater possibilities. There is a superb ready-made implementation of Foundation 5 for Wordpress with both CSS and SASS distributions called [JointsWP][jointswp]. A terrific head start! Anything like that is going to add some more includes and loops for more maze to amazing but it is well worth the extra effort to learn more ropes.
