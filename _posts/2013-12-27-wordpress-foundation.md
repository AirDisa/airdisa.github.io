If you are going to get into development, you are bound to run into Wordpress. Wordpress is popular. It powers roughly 20% of the Web, which is a 5% increase over the last such milestone I remember hearing. For many, Wordpress is all they care to do, perhaps all they know. As much as I might prefer learning other things, mostly all of us are stuck hacking on Wordpress at some point.

Wordpress means mazes of PHP includes and loops. At the time of this writing, the newest version contains fewer horrors than previous versions but plenty of horror nonetheless. For one thing the workflow can be pretty messed up, unless you want to mess with Wordpress on your own machine. I am not a big fan of the idea, but understand why those who do that, do that. I admit to have done it, though I prefer to hotfix.

Foundation (latest version 5), the responsive framework which beats Twitter Bootstrap, can shoehorn into Wordpress and give it great possible outcomes. There is a relatively empty ready-made install of Foundation 5 called [JointsWP][joints-wp] that is a terrific jump start point. Anything like that is going to add more includes and loops for more maze to amazing but it is well worth the effort to learn the ropes.
