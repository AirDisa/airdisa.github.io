Starting the night with Trans4Hack @Devbootcamp #Chicago. We are just gathering for the evening boreforehand, although I imagine there will be some talk as TransGeek is a film in progress. I signed a release and may make ocassional appearances. People are allowed to opt out so as not to be outted IRL. I met the founder, and Aaron is here - yay!  found out because of a new job that Coraline was meant to be here is actually in Salt Lake city presumably there to talk shop. Instructure?

The founder is talking about this being the third one. GitHub is one of the sponsors, and all our hacking is going to be open source. We will start with GitHub tutorial. We have GitHub presence here (Scottish) to actually walk us through. He is talking through the versioning of what GitHub is by way of explanation. Pitching GitHub which is the platform of popularity and a solid recommendation besides. Like fish in a barrel. Here we go repos, yay!

One maddening thing bugging me now is :set nowrap is not working. Gah! It will probably work fine outside NERDTree but I like NERDTree. Aw well. If Aaron is correct, then I will be in a position to mentor here, and I would like that if I can do a good enough job. That job description might entail me bringing a bona fide laptop instead of this iPad with SSH client. Aw well, maybe not! I would like to continue without a laptop but I want :set nowrap to work for that.
