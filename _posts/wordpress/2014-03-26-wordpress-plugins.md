Regrettably I get a lot of Wordpress work. The expression of regret here is a result of reluctance for delving into the code of others, as well as the fact that the interface completely confuses me. I swear by the names of the functions in the codex the Jalopy was written by GTA game boys (strip teaser, really?). The other mad thing about it is the ecosystem is made up of a library of code written by people, some of whom are out to do harm.

So it is. The thing that I get to see is the awful markup it produces, especially after a good ravaging from plugins that further terrorize the already top-heavy code. But hey, it is supposed to be search engine friendly so everyone uses it. What about actually optimized? People get hooked and do what they know, except they don&quot;t always know what they don&quot;t know. So when SEO plugins are used, there is typically a field for Google Analytics.

What some people who shouldn&quot;t design who do design should know is that when you place the Google Analytics code in a field of a plugin you just installed, and you add it to another on another occasion, these plugins each will add it to your markup and you only need it once. Stuff like that does not seem very serious, and it isn&quot;t. It is a mistake, however, that should be fixed. If I am paid to provide feedback, it is feedback I will provide.
