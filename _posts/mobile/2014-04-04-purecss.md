I was able to take the time in the last few weeks to add a Pure CSS template with a little design to it. I am not known for my design prowesss, and was perfectly happy to steal from their excellent freely available open source offerings. Since this site is a blog, I went with the obvious choice of the blog demo. Once thing I establshed as well, was with the use of a little JavaScript I sniff for mobile browser user-agents for a conditional of the large image and some formatting.
