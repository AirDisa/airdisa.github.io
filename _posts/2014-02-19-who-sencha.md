I first came across Sencha a few years ago, before I dug in and learned more about it last weekend. I fell in love with the framework, which was fitting as it was Valentine&quot;s Day when I started. Like love at first sight, there are always things I will not see for the blindness of it all until things become clearer later. While Sencha is fully featured with robust documentation (venture capital backed), it is not SEO friendly.
