Publishing LSI through Jekyll works locally while it does not at GitHub Pages because they run the build process without plugins. My personal preference is not deviating from a standard Jekyll implementation. This means that LSI will display locally and a only list of posts by date will appear at GitHub Pages. I am not altogether happy with a temporary solution I invoked as I mull over an alternate solution I came across in a search for something better. I wrote a straight forward JavaScript to link here when the host is GitHub.
