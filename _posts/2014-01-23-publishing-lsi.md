Publishing LSI using the simplest possible configuration, to me this means not deviating from a standard Jekyll implementation. Unfortunately, this also means that I would like the same codebase at my own location that resides at GitHub. The thing that will display differently, is of course the LSI which will not be included in the build process at GitHub versus what I can do locally. So I came up with a temporary solution while I mull over the rather snaky alternate solution that I came across in my search. I am not altogether happy with either thing but at least by publishing LSI locally, I can add a remote reference to it. I wrote a straight forward JavaScript to add a link when host is GitHub. Visitors to GitHub Pages will see the link.
