Publishing LSI using the simplest possible configuration, to me this means not deviating from a standard Jekyll implementation. If I can live with something inconvenient, as long as it buys me something in exchange, I can deal with it. This is especially true when it comes to a temporary compromise that I can easily implement while chewing on the problem a bit more to see if an elegant solution comes to me given my particular circumstances. I am undertaking that kind of thing with respect to the issue of Latent Semantic Indexing and Jekyll. Aw well. I host the source of this website at GitHub. I host the website using GitHub Pages too but do not need to. This prompts me to want to move to use Jekyll for BeginSmarter with links from GitHub Pages.

I wrote a straight forward JavaScript to add a link when host is GitHub so visitors to the GitHub Pages will see a link to BeginSmarter. I will have them directed to a page that explains the LSI issue and the reasoning behind why it is not working at GitHub Pages when they can see it in action at BeginSmarter where they will already be when they read it. This means I will move to using Jekyll for powering BeginSmarter. Since I have some pre-existing content, I need to think about how I want to integrate it. I want to use libraries such as YUI, and experiment with apps in frameworks such as Rails. Should be interesting going.
