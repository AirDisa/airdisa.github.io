The only thing this post really has to do with security is by virtue of the original Orwellian commercial for the Mac, the machine which brought computing to the masses. This has led to our security and privacy concerns that we have today. It is a long video that starts with plenty of hype from Steve Jobs. About 45 minutes in, the demonstration really shows the environment in which the Mac was originally released, which is what made it insanely great and revolutionary through the lens of today. It is important to remember this is version one, the very beginning of something huge. I loved watching this as a truly important historical frame.

There is one other important area where security comes into play with this video. That is where Steve Wozniak speaks of computer user groups where the Apple computer company grew out of. This is the same timing and area of interest shared by the original hackers, such as Captain Crunch and Kevin Mitnick. When I spoke with Kevin about ciphers for his book, as we went through them by phone, he needed to get off the phone to call Woz because we had just learned of the death of Steve Jobs. That may be an intricate detail on the fringe of the subject of security. To me, it ties in very nicely as a matter of events which played out through the beginning of the information age.
