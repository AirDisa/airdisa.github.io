[Tags][tags] for posts are also supported in Jekyll. The fun is getting totally out of hand. I went in knowing this but wanted to reserve my use of tags for some special thing. But what? I am *supposed* to be kind of a big deal in SEO. I can think of nifty things that influence people, right? Influence people? Well, not many SEOs are going to learn Jekyll. That is why I love it so. I do not carry any illusions that I influence anyone much anymore. If I write good keywords, I can build a better search engine that uses them. SEOs concern themselves with business first much as I did, and I lost sight of code.

I feel like a kid again. I do not concern myself much with SEO. I prefer experimenting with how to manipulate the Jekyll implementation of tags for posts to stretch their meaning and develop a search engine my own way. I am pretty sure the notion of tags in Jekyll is based on tradition, with flexibility for developers to take it further. I dutifully populate tags accordingly. I can easily write tags and use them in the standard way for tag clouds and for populating meta keywords. Along with the excerpt feature that also comes complimentary with Jekyll, I place all the essential meta data in simple YAML Front Matter.

Everybody in SEO knows that keywords fail for improving rankings. They used to work fifteen years ago. People stopped writing them after Google came to rely on links more than anything, which worked perfectly for basic search. Since they also had excellent indexing the Web, even advanced search performed admirably. Since 1999 I had instructed my mother she ought to use Google, although at the time I was using all the search engines. My favorite was Altavista. It is sad people stopped writing keywords. People should continue writing them for the successor search engine. That successor could be you. In my case it is me.
