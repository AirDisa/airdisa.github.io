The best time to learn version control is beginning before your first version. Register with GitHub, or refresh you familiarity with GitHub if you registered and haven't used it enough. GitHub is more than version control, it's where developers hang out. GitHub is the skateboard park for developers and where company scouts look for talent.

<ul>
  <li>GitHub: A version tracking system with collaboration features.</li>
  <li>Gist: A file, or group of files at GitHub to share or demonstrate code.</li>
  <li>Repo: A central code repository that can be branched for larger collaboration.</li>
</ul>

There are several parts to GitHub, and implementations. The first thing you'll probably notice is the activity. Try to focus on learning about gists and repos browsing them. A gist is a file, or a few files grouped together. A benefit of learning how to use gists is you can embed them in html code. All you need is to know how to edit the following src attribute for the specific gist you want:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AirDisa/8124295.js"></script>

GitHub Repos is where version control really kicks into high gear. Repos have the capability to branch like a tree. This allows collaboration and feature contributions from other developers. The idea is write code, contribute to code repositories and documentation by others for personal growth. It's never too late to start and it's always a good idea to get going.
