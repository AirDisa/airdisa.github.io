The best time to learn version control is before your first version. I use GitHub, which offers much more than version control. There are several parts to GitHub, there are several implementations. The first thing you&#39;ll probably notice is activity. I was pretty confused at first. Try to focus learning about gists and repos by browsing them. A gist is a file, or a few files grouped together. You can embed gists in html code. All you do is place its number identifier for the src attribute like so:

<ul>
  <li>GitHub: A version tracking system with collaboration features.</li>
  <li>Gist: Files at GitHub for simple sharing with automatic code highlighting.</li>
  <li>Repo: A central location for version control of code repositories that can be branched or forked for larger collaboration via &#39;pull requests&#39; that can be merged back in. A GitHub repo is the heart of the service and where the most powerful features are.</li>
</ul>

GitHub Repos is where version control really kicks into high gear. Repos have the capability to branch like a tree and merge back in or be discarded. It is possible to fork an entire repo and continue from that point to develop independently presuming copyrights left intact. This allows new software projects, collaborations and feature contributions. The idea is write code, contribute to code repos and documentation for personal growth. Like Twitter, it is never too late to start and those who have gone before will already be established.
