Determined to add content here, I took note of the [pagination][pagination] feature built right in to Jekyll. I had put this aside until now, for reasons of busyness, but now I have taken it upon myself to actually implement the pagination scheme. This helps me get the feel for Jekyll better before I get to doing something more complicated. I know it takes a great effort to contribute on a daily basis and failure is not unknown to me or those with dead blogs laying around.

While looking at plugins I might like to install, or roll my own by writing one from scratch, one of the things I stumbled upon reading in the documentation is a flat file data store. How cool is that? While seeing lots of reference to YAML, I had not really delved too deeply in it for the simple matter of time. I know learning it is brainlessly fast, and I therefore will put something like that off until implementation time, just like Jekyll itself.

So all this is enough to keep me busy learning fun stuff while trying to not fall behind on commercial coding work. I have become caught up enough in it that I could only add pagination in the short time I took for a break before getting back to working on paying code. So the plan is to dabble with writing a plugin, potentially using YAML data constructs and enjoy watching the pagination at work the more I write. Somewhere in there I better add CSS, maybe Foundation 5 on SASS.
