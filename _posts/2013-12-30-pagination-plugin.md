Determined to add content here, I previously took note of the [pagination][pagination] feature built right in to Jekyll. I put pagination aside until now, for reasons of busyness. I have finally taken it upon myself to implement the pagination code on the index page. This has helped me get the feel for Jekyll better as I get to starting something more complicated.

It is enough to keep me busy learning fun stuff, while not falling behind on commercial coding work. I could only add pagination to index in the short time I took for a break before getting back to paying code. Perhaps I will add pagination to the Jekyll index, since writing this little piece tallies enough posts.

The plan for what is next, after pagination is to dabble with writing a simple Ruby plugin, potentially using YAML data constructs. While looking at pagination one of the things I stumbled upon was flat file YAML data store. Having seen lots of reference to YAML, I had not delved too deeply looking at it for the simple matter of time.

I know learning YAML is going to be brainlessly fast. I often put something like YAML off until implementation time, just like I did Jekyll itself. Looking at something like YAML is, in effect, learning YAML by osmosis. Memorizing enough to write it without referring to documentation is all it that is left.
