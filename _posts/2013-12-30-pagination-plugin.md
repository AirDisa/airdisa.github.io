Determined to add content here, I previously took note of the Jekyll [pagination][pagination] feature. I put pagination aside until now, for reasons of busyness. I finally took it upon myself to implement the code on the index page. This has helped me get the feel for Jekyll better as I get to work on something more complicated. It is enough to keep me busy learning this fun stuff, while not falling behind on commercial coding. I could only add pagination to index in the short time I took for a break, there is not enough content anyway. I will eventually add pagination to the Jekyll index too, since writing this little piece tallies enough posts to warrant that.

The plan for after exploring all Jekyll-made plugins is to dabble with writing plugins myself. While looking at pagination, one of the things I stumbled upon was the flat file YAML data store. Having seen lots of reference to YAML, I had not delved too deeply looking at it for saving time. It is a lot like JSON anyway. I know learning YAML is going to be brainlessly fast. I often put learning something like that off until implementation time, just like I did Jekyll itself. I know I can learn as I go at a fast clip. Looking at something like YAML is in effect, learning YAML by osmosis. Memorizing enough of it to write without referring to documentation is all it that is left.
