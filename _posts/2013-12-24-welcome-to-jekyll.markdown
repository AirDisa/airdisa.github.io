Jekyll offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Disa')
#=> prints 'Hi, Disa' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

This blog is hosted using free [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] and powered by templating (more info on [Jekyll][jekyll]). Open source code repositories that I'm actively working on or participating in can be found at my [GitHub repository][airdisa-repos].
